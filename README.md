# Creating FARS package

## Final Assignment of the Coursera Course "Building R packages"

For this Coursera assessment a package "fars" has been developed which uses data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality 
Analysis Reporting System, a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor 
vehicle traffic crashes.

The purpose of this assessment is to combine skills of creating, writing, documenting, and testing an R package with releasing 
that package on GitHub.
